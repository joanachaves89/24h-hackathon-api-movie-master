# 24h-hackathon-api-movie-master
A webpage called "Le Gammar." This project was part of a 24-hour hackathon. The theme for this hackathon was Quentin Tarantino's movie 'Inglourious Basterds.' We created a cinema ticket sales webpage inspired by the movie's theme. The project was developed by a team consisting of five members.
